Methods of access
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.
The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside of the Wikipedia website.

Websites is thousands of "mirror sites" exist that republish content from Wikipedia.
Another example is Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.
